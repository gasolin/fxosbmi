the structure is based on [webapplate](https://github.com/gasolin/webapplate), which provide best practices for newly webapp development.

Note: If you use the Add Directory option in the Simulator, make sure to change "launch_path": "/fxosbmi/public/index.html" to "launch_path": "index.html" and the icon paths accordingly since it runs it as a packaged app directly from the root folder.
